By generating sounds and visuals from the imaginative world, we create this monster which symbolizes AI's self-consumption and the resultant artifacts of recursion. It asks: Who becomes the noise within this system? And what role do we play as both contributors to and consumers of this endless loop, where even the darkest corners of human expression are subject to the distorting influence of generative AI?A greedy miner, after discovering a large gold nugget in the Sierra Nevada, refuses to share his fortune and exploits other miners.

It asks: Who becomes the noise within this system? And what role do we play as both contributors to and consumers of this endless loop, where even the darkest corners of human expression are subject to the distorting influence of generative AI?A greedy miner, after discovering a large gold nugget in the Sierra Nevada, refuses to share his fortune and exploits other miners. One night, while digging deeper into the earth in search of more gold, he encounters an ancient spirit of the land. The spirit curses him for his greed, causing him to grow a tail. This tail, a symbol of his insatiable greed, grows longer with each act of selfishness. The miner becomes a reclusive figure, hiding his tail and his gold, but eventually goes mad, haunted by the spirit and the weight of his greed.

By generating sounds and visuals from the imaginative world, we create this monster which symbolizes AI's self-consumption and the resultant artifacts of recursion. It asks: Who becomes the noise within this system? And what role do we play as both contributors to and consumers of this endless loop, where even the darkest corners of human expression are subject to the distorting influence of generative AI?

In the current form of this paradigm shift, the development and implementation of these systems are dominated by a narrow subset of society. Additionally, the corpus of data leveraged to train these models instills a biased and reductionist version of the totality of collective consciousness, into the models.

We intend to explore this recursive system of biased cyclical decay through the use of an embodied storytelling installation, leveraging oral folklore stories as the subject and metaphor, to explore, critique, and provoke curiosity into speculative manifestations of our symbiotic future.

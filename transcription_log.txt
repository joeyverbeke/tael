By generating sounds and visuals from the imaginative world, we create this monster which symbolizes AI's self-consumption and the resultant artifacts of recursion. It asks: Who becomes the noise within this system? And what role do we play as both contributors to and consumers of this endless loop, where even the darkest corners of human expression are subject to the distorting influence of generative AI?

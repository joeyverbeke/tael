    "Activated by the oldest existing collection of folklore stories, we intend to explore the intersection of ancient, historical folklore ghosts and the Artificial Intelligence ghosts with the poignant echo of the cyclical decay of the evolution of these generative systems. In the current form of this paradigm shift, the development and implementation of these systems are dominated by a narrow subset of society. Additionally, the corpus of data leveraged to train these models instills a biased and reductionist version of the “totality of collective consciousness”, into the models.",
    "Further, at the current inflection point of this paradigm shift, we now see a proliferation of this generated synthetic data polluting the training data of the internet. We intend to explore this recursive system of biased cyclical decay through the use of an embodied storytelling installation, leveraging oral folklore stories as the subject and metaphor, to explore, critique, and provoke curiosity into speculative manifestations of our symbiotic future. ",
    "Inspired by the cybernetic information theory around negative feedback loop and noise, we are trying to explore the echo unique to our time: the recursive spell of humanity empowered agents. By generating sounds and visuals from the imaginative world, we create this monster which symbolizes AI's self-consumption and the resultant artifacts of recursion. It asks: Who becomes the noise within this system? And what role do we play as both contributors to and consumers of this endless loop, where even the darkest corners of human expression are subject to the distorting influence of generative AI?"
    "A greedy miner, after discovering a large gold nugget in the Sierra Nevada, refuses to share his fortune and exploits other miners. One night, while digging deeper into the earth in search of more gold, he encounters an ancient spirit of the land. The spirit curses him for his greed, causing him to grow a tail. This tail, a symbol of his insatiable greed, grows longer with each act of selfishness. The miner becomes a reclusive figure, hiding his tail and his gold, but eventually goes mad, haunted by the spirit and the weight of his greed.",
    "A sailor, part of the many crews that docked in San Francisco, brings with him a mystical artifact stolen from a distant land. Unbeknownst to him, the artifact is cursed. The more he profits from the black market trade, the more he starts to change. First, small physical changes occur, then he grows a tail, marking him as cursed. He becomes a legend among the sailors and dock workers, a cautionary tale of the dangers of greed and theft.",
    "In the Sierra Nevada mountains, a prospector disappears for several months. When he returns to San Francisco, he has a tail and a strange story. He claims to have found a hidden vein of gold guarded by creatures with tails. They offered him riches but cursed him with a tail as a mark of his trespassing. The prospector becomes a figure of fascination and fear, his story a mix of wonder and warning about the hidden dangers in the quest for gold.",

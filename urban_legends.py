    "Activated by the oldest existing collection of folklore stories, we intend to explore the intersection of ancient, historical folklore ghosts and the Artificial Intelligence ghosts with the poignant echo of the cyclical decay of the evolution of these generative systems. In the current form of this paradigm shift, the development and implementation of these systems are dominated by a narrow subset of society. Additionally, the corpus of data leveraged to train these models instills a biased and reductionist version of the “totality of collective consciousness”, into the models.",
    "Further, at the current inflection point of this paradigm shift, we now see a proliferation of this generated synthetic data polluting the training data of the internet. We intend to explore this recursive system of biased cyclical decay through the use of an embodied storytelling installation, leveraging oral folklore stories as the subject and metaphor, to explore, critique, and provoke curiosity into speculative manifestations of our symbiotic future. ",
    "Inspired by the cybernetic information theory around negative feedback loop and noise, we are trying to explore the echo unique to our time: the recursive spell of humanity empowered agents. By generating sounds and visuals from the imaginative world, we create this monster which symbolizes AI's self-consumption and the resultant artifacts of recursion. It asks: Who becomes the noise within this system? And what role do we play as both contributors to and consumers of this endless loop, where even the darkest corners of human expression are subject to the distorting influence of generative AI?"
